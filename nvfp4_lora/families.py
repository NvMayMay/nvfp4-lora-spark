"""Single source of truth for per-family model knowledge.

Every component that needs to know how a model family lays out its checkpoint
(the unified trainer, the loader's key translator, the fused-3D MoE replacer,
the checkpoint inspector, and the merge scripts) reads from this registry.
Adding support for a new NVFP4 family should mean adding ONE entry here plus
tests, not editing loader/trainer/merge bodies.

Registry fields, per `config.json` `model_type`:

  auto_class            which transformers Auto* builds the right text-trainable
                        graph: "causal_lm" or "image_text_to_text"
  expert_prefix         (in_memory_prefix, safetensors_prefix) for the text
                        backbone. Used for routed-expert key assembly AND for
                        translating PEFT adapter keys to on-disk base keys at
                        merge time (the two are the same translation).
  peft_scope            regex prefix anchoring PEFT target_modules to the text
                        backbone (so multimodal towers can never match a bare
                        suffix)
  freeze                submodules of model.model to freeze (multimodal towers)
  skip_st_prefixes      safetensors key prefixes that are intentionally never
                        loaded for text-only training (vision tower, projector,
                        MTP speculation layers). This is the explicit allowlist
                        for "tensor on disk, absent in the training graph".
  st_to_model           ordered (st_prefix, model_prefix) rewrite rules mapping
                        safetensors keys to in-memory attribute paths; first
                        match wins, unmatched keys pass through verbatim.
                        None means the layout cannot be expressed statically
                        and the loader's dynamic fallback translator applies
                        (Nemotron: Nano materializes the backbone as
                        `backbone.*` but Super as `model.*` under the SAME
                        model_type, so the prefix is probed from the live
                        module tree)
  meta_allowed_prefixes in-memory parameter-path prefixes allowed to remain on
                        the meta device after loading (text-only training never
                        materializes the multimodal towers). Everything else on
                        meta after load is a load bug and fails the no-meta
                        assertion.
  moe_experts_class     HF module class name of the fused-3D routed-experts
                        block this family uses (replaced by NVFP4Experts3D),
                        or None if the family has no supported fused-3D MoE

Optional VLM (vision-LoRA) fields — present ONLY on families that support
`--train-target vision`; every text-only family and the generic fallback omit
them, so text runs are byte-for-byte unaffected (`_REQUIRED_FAMILY_KEYS`
unchanged). The presence of `vision_peft_scope` is the capability flag: a family
without it refuses `--train-target vision`. `family_view(fam, target)` derives
the EFFECTIVE per-run family from these; the loader/trainer consume that view, so
the toggle is one conditional at the top, not N scattered across loader bodies.

  vision_peft_scope     regex anchoring the LoRA target scope to the vision
                        tower (so a bare q_proj in the tower matches while the
                        text backbone never does)
  vision_target_suffixes default projection suffixes for the tower + projector
  projector_modules     multimodal-connector submodule name(s) that straddle
                        text<->vision; a default vision-mode LoRA target,
                        NEVER a text-mode target, and never left on meta in
                        vision mode
  vision_st_prefixes    on-disk safetensors prefixes of the tower + projector.
                        In vision mode these are SUBTRACTED from skip_st_prefixes
                        (their bf16 weights must load) and drive the coverage
                        inventory's vision restriction.
  vision_st_to_model    extra (st_prefix, model_prefix) rewrite rules that map
                        the tower/projector on-disk keys to their in-memory
                        attribute paths (in text mode the tower is skipped, so
                        the base st_to_model omits them)
  vision_freeze         submodules of model.model that make up the TEXT backbone;
                        frozen in vision mode (the inverse of `freeze`)
